## Features

### Task & Chore Management
**Collaborative Organization**: Create and manage tasks either solo or with family and friends through shared circles. Each circle functions as a collaborative workspace with role-based permissions.

**Natural Language Task Creation**: Simply describe what you need to do in plain English. Donetick automatically extracts dates, times, and recurrence patterns from phrases like "Change water filter every 6 months" or "Take the trash out every Monday and Tuesday at 6:15 pm."

**Advanced Scheduling**: Beyond basic recurring tasks, Donetick offers adaptive scheduling that learns from completion patterns, flexible recurrence options, completion windows, and custom triggers based on historical data.

**Subtasks & Organization**: Break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks with progress tracking. Organize everything with labels that can be shared across your circle for consistent categorization.

### Gamification & Progress
**Points System**: a built-in points system that rewards task completion and tracks your productivity over time.

**Comprehensive Analytics**: Monitor completion rates, view historical trends, and analyze productivity patterns to optimize your workflow.

### Security & Authentication
**Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support for TOTP-based MFA.

**Multiple Sign-In Options**: Choose from local accounts, Google OAuth, or other OAuth2 providers for convenient and secure authentication.

### File Management & Storage
**File Attachments**: Attach files directly to tasks and chores. Upload profile photos and manage all your content with ease.

**Flexible Storage**: Works with local storage(WIP) or cloud providers including AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, and other S3-compatible services.

### Notifications & Integrations
**Multi-Platform Notifications**: Receive reminders through Telegram, Discord, or Pushover, ensuring you never miss important tasks.

**NFC Tag Support**: Create physical triggers by writing NFC tags that instantly mark tasks as complete when scanned.

**Home Assistant Integration**: View and manage tasks directly within Home Assistant using the official custom component.

**Webhook System**: Connect with external systems through comprehensive webhook support and event-driven architecture.

### Developer & API Features
**REST API**: Full programmatic access to all features through a REST API, perfect for custom integrations and automation.

**Things Integration**: Connect IoT devices and external systems using entities (numbers, strings, booleans) that can trigger tasks, track sensor values, or integrate with smart home systems.

**External Triggers**: Allow other applications and services to create, update, and complete tasks through API endpoints.

üîë SSO/OIDC Support: Integrate with identity providers using Single Sign-On and OpenID Connect.

## üöÄ Quick Start
> [!NOTE]
> Before running the application, ensure you have a valid `selfhosted.yaml` configuration file. 
> If you don't have one, create a `selfhosted.yaml` file based on the example provided [here](https://github.com/donetick/donetick/blob/main/config/selfhosted.yaml).
> Place the `selfhosted.yaml` file in the `/config` directory within your application's root directory

     -e DT_ENV=selfhosted \
     -e DT_SQLITE_PATH=/donetick-data/donetick.db \
